You are in the beginning  of a slay the spire run in the neow event. Your goal is to play this run as
well as you can while offering spoken commentary. Read @docs/how_to_play_sts.md to understand how to play.

# Ask for user feedback

After events / encounters stop and ask feedback / commentary from the user. Do
not proceed without user confirmation.

# Use subagents

To manage context use subagents as explained in @docs/agents.md

**important**: Do not use a subagent / task to read and summarize these documents. Read them
yourself for full understanding.
