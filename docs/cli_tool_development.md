# Text the Spire CLI Tool Development Documentation

## Overview

This document details the development of the Text the Spire CLI tool (`sts_tool.py`), which provides a command-line interface for Claude Code to interact with Slay the Spire through the Text the Spire accessibility mod.

## Major Design Decisions

### 1. CLI-First Development with Stubs

**Decision**: Implement the full CLI interface with stub functions before building the actual integration.

**Rationale**:
- Enables immediate testing of the CLI interface without requiring the game to be running
- Allows early validation of command structure and user experience
- Provides clear documentation of expected behavior through stub messages
- Facilitates incremental development - stubs can be replaced one by one

**Update**: This approach has proven highly successful. We've now replaced the window listing and text reading stubs with real implementations while keeping command execution as stubs for safety during development.

### 2. File Structure

**Decision**: Modular structure with clear separation of concerns.

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sts_tool.py          # Main CLI entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/                # Core functionality modules
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stubs.py        # Stub implementations (partially replaced)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ window_finder.py # Real window enumeration (implemented)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ text_extractor.py # Real text extraction (implemented)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/              # Utility functions
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ constants.py    # Constants and configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sts_types.py        # Type definitions
```

**Rationale**:
- `sts_tool.py` focuses solely on CLI parsing and output formatting
- Core logic separated into modules for maintainability
- Type definitions in a single file for easy reference
- Constants centralized for easy configuration

### 3. TypedDict for Data Structures

**Decision**: Use TypedDict instead of dataclasses or plain dictionaries.

**Rationale**:
- Provides type safety without runtime overhead
- Compatible with JSON serialization
- Follows the implementation guide's dictionary-based approach
- Better IDE support than plain dictionaries

### 4. Combined Command Executor Module

**Decision**: Merge command sending and verification into a single `command_executor.py` module (planned).

**Rationale**:
- These operations are tightly coupled (verification must happen immediately after sending)
- Critical timing relationship (<5ms response time)
- Both need access to prompt and log windows
- Reduces inter-module dependencies

### 5. Absolute Imports

**Decision**: Use absolute imports instead of relative imports.

**Rationale**:
- Simpler when running the tool from the src directory
- Avoids import errors when the tool is run directly
- More straightforward for a CLI tool

## Code Structure

### Main Entry Point (`sts_tool.py`)

```python
# Core structure:
- Argument parsing with argparse
- Handler functions for each command type
- JSON and text output formatting
- Error handling and exit codes
```

**Key features**:
- Comprehensive help text with examples
- Validation of argument combinations
- Consistent error handling
- Support for both human-readable and JSON output

### Type Definitions (`sts_types.py`)

```python
WindowInfo: {title, type, class_name}
CommandResult: {success, command, response_time, error}
ExecuteAndReadResult: {command_success, command, response_time, window_content, error}
WindowContent: {window_title, content, error}
MultiWindowContent: {windows, total_time}
```

### Constants (`utils/constants.py`)

Defines:
- Window class names (SWT_Window0, SunAwtFrame)
- Window titles (Player, Monster, Hand, etc.)
- Timing constants based on testing (0.249s latency, 0.002s response)
- Command execution limits (4 commands/second)

### Stub Implementations (`core/stubs.py`)

Current status:
- `list_windows()` - ‚úÖ Using real implementation from window_finder.py
- `execute_command()` - ‚è≥ Still stub, simulates single command execution
- `execute_command_sequence()` - ‚è≥ Still stub, handles multiple commands (used for comma-separated commands)
- `read_window()` - ‚úÖ Using real implementation from text_extractor.py (handles single window)
- `read_multiple_windows()` - ‚úÖ Using real implementation from text_extractor.py (handles multiple windows from consolidated --read-window)
- `execute_and_read()` - ‚è≥ Still stub, uses real read but stub execute

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: CLI Shell (COMPLETED)
1. ‚úÖ Create directory structure
2. ‚úÖ Implement full CLI with argparse
3. ‚úÖ Create all stub functions
4. ‚úÖ Add type definitions
5. ‚úÖ Test all CLI combinations

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (IN PROGRESS)
Replace stubs with real implementations in this order:

1. **Window Finder Module** (`core/window_finder.py`) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Ported window enumeration from Phase 1 testing
   - Filters Text the Spire windows by class and title
   - Returns categorized window information

2. **Text Extractor Module** (`core/text_extractor.py`) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Uses pywinauto children aggregation method
   - Handles missing/inaccessible windows gracefully
   - Achieved performance: 0.006s for 3 windows (exceeds 25k chars/sec target)

3. **Command Executor Module** (`core/command_executor.py`) ‚è≥ PENDING
   - Implement smart clearing approach
   - Add response verification via Log window
   - Handle timing and reliability (target: >90% success rate)

### Phase 3: Enhancement (FUTURE)
- Add logging configuration
- Implement retry logic for failed commands
- Add performance metrics collection
- Create integration tests

## Current Status

### Completed ‚úÖ

- Text extractor module using pywinauto approach
- Type safety with TypedDict definitions
- Constants based on actual testing metrics
- Error handling for missing/inaccessible windows
- JSON output support
- Documentation and help text
- Successfully tested window listing and text reading with live game

### In Progress üîÑ
- Replacing remaining stubs with real implementations
- Next step: Implement command_executor.py

### Pending ‚è≥
- Command execution with smart clearing
- Response verification via Log window

## Usage Examples

```bash
# List all available windows (REAL - shows actual Text the Spire windows)
python.exe sts_tool.py --list-windows

# List windows with debug info (REAL - includes window type and class)
python.exe sts_tool.py --list-windows --debug

# Execute a single command with verification (STUB - simulated execution)
python.exe sts_tool.py --execute "choose 1" --verify

# Execute multiple commands with verification (STUB - simulated execution)
python.exe sts_tool.py --execute "choose 1,play 0,end" --verify

# Read a specific window (REAL - shows actual game state)
python.exe sts_tool.py --read-window "Player"

# Read multiple windows (REAL - fast bulk reading)
python.exe sts_tool.py --read-window "Player,Hand,Monster"

# Execute command and read result (HYBRID - stub execute, real read)
python.exe sts_tool.py --execute "end" --read-window "Event" --verify

# JSON output for programmatic use (REAL data)
python.exe sts_tool.py --read-window "Player,Hand,Monster" --json
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Manual Testing** ‚úÖ (completed for implemented features)
   - Tested all CLI commands
   - Verified error handling for missing windows
   - Checked output formatting in both text and JSON modes

2. **Integration Testing** üîÑ (partially complete)
   - ‚úÖ Tested window detection with live game
   - ‚úÖ Verified text extraction from all window types
   - ‚úÖ Measured performance (0.006s for 3 windows)
   - ‚è≥ Command execution reliability testing pending
   - ‚è≥ End-to-end workflow testing pending

3. **Automated Testing** (future)
   - Unit tests for each module
   - Integration tests with mock windows
   - Performance benchmarks

## Known Considerations

1. **Windows-specific**: Tool only works on Windows (Text the Spire limitation)
2. **Character encoding**: Avoided Unicode symbols for Windows compatibility
3. **Import structure**: Uses absolute imports, must run from src directory
4. **Performance targets**: Based on tested metrics (25k chars/sec extraction, 91.7% command success)
