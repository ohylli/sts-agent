# Phase 1: Feasibility Testing - Task Plan

## Overview
Phase 1 focuses on proving the basic technical feasibility of interacting with Slay the Spire through the "Text the Spire" mod. This mod provides text windows showing game state and a prompt window for entering commands. We will ONLY interact with these Text the Spire windows - NOT the game's native UI. The goal is to identify the most reliable approach for reading text windows and sending commands.

## Success Criteria
- Successfully read game state from Text the Spire's text windows
- Successfully send commands through Text the Spire's prompt window
- Identify the most reliable technical approach for text window interaction
- Document pros/cons of each method tested
- Confirm we can interact WITHOUT touching the game's native UI

## Notes

### Important: Text the Spire Interaction Model
**We are NOT automating the game's native UI.** The Text the Spire mod provides:
- Multiple text windows displaying game state information
- A prompt window for entering text commands

Our agent will ONLY:
1. Read text from Text the Spire's game state windows
2. Send commands to Text the Spire's prompt window

We will NOT:
- Click on game buttons or UI elements
- Interact with game menus directly
- Automate any part of the game's native interface

### Testing Priority
1. Start by identifying all Text the Spire windows
2. Test both pywinauto and Windows API for text reading
3. Focus on reliable text extraction from Text the Spire windows
4. Ensure command input works through Text the Spire prompt
5. Never attempt to automate the game's native UI

### Key Metrics to Track
- Success rate of reading text from Text the Spire windows
- Accuracy of parsed Text the Spire output
- Latency of text reading operations
- Command input success rate via Text the Spire prompt
- Stability of Text the Spire window handles over time
- Resource usage


## Next Steps After Phase 1
Based on the findings from this phase:
1. Complete CLI tool implementation with real functionality
2. Select primary technical approach for Text the Spire interaction
3. Design agent architecture around text-based communication
4. Begin Phase 2: Core Text the Spire output parsing
5. Develop command abstraction layer for Text the Spire prompt
